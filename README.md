# Digit-Regonition-Using-CNN
Overview :-
This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition using deep learning. It utilizes datasets such as the IAM Handwriting Dataset and the GNHK Handwritten Notes Dataset to train a model capable of recognizing handwritten digits.

## Features :-
- Preprocessing of handwritten data
- Training and evaluation of deep learning models
- Handwritten digit classification
- Custom image testing for recognition

## Dataset :-
- GNHK Handwritten Notes Dataset (516 JPG files)
- I AM Handwriting Dataset (Optional for additional training)

## Custom Image Testing :-
To test a single handwritten image, add the image to the directory and modify the notebook to load and predict the custom file.

# Future Enhancements :-
- Improving accuracy with more training data
- Deploying as a web API
- Adding real-time digit recognition
- Contributing
