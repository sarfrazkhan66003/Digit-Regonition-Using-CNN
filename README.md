# Digit-Regonition-Using-CNN
Overview :-
This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition using deep learning. It utilizes datasets such as the IAM Handwriting Dataset and the GNHK Handwritten Notes Dataset to train a model capable of recognizing handwritten digits.

Features :-
Preprocessing of handwritten data
Training and evaluation of deep learning models
Handwritten digit classification
Custom image testing for recognition

Dataset :-
GNHK Handwritten Notes Dataset (516 JPG files)
IAM Handwriting Dataset (Optional for additional training)

Custom Image Testing :-
To test a single handwritten image, add the image to the directory and modify the notebook to load and predict the custom file.

Future Enhancements :-
Improving accuracy with more training data
Deploying as a web API
Adding real-time digit recognition
